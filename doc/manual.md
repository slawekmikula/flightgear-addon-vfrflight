# Add-on usage

Add-on enables communication with VFRFlight software. Provides online information
of player's aircraft to the VFRFlight (http://vfrflight.org) flight planning
software.

# FlightGear configuration

Next start FlightGear. Go to menu `Add-on -> Linux Head Track`.

![alt menu](screens/fg_menu.png "Add-on menu")

There you can enable linuxtrack protocol and enable tracking of the selected
orientations (x/y/z) separately. When the tracking is enabled and the LinuxTrack application
(ltr_pipe) is running in the background you should be able to control the view
direction only by your head movement.
